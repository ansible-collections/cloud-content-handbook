# Scrum Ceremonies: What, When, and How

This document provides an overview of the key Scrum ceremonies, detailing what they are, when they occur, and how they should be conducted, specifically for the Cloud Content Team.

**1. Sprint Planning**

- **What**: Sprint Planning is the ceremony where the Scrum Team discusses and plans the work for the upcoming sprint. The goal is to define the Sprint Goal, decide which backlog items will be worked on, and how the team will accomplish the work.
- **When**: At the beginning of each sprint, typically on the first day of the sprint.
- **How**:
    - The Delivery Team’s 3-in-the-box (Product Owner) presents the prioritized Product Backlog.
    - The Delivery Team collaborates to clarify any items and decide which tasks can be completed in the sprint.
    - The Sprint Goal is defined, providing a clear focus for the sprint.
    - Tickets are pulled into or removed from the sprint as needed to reflect the sprint goal and team capacity.
    - The sprint is officially started.

**2. Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)**

- **What**: The Daily Standup is a brief meeting where team members share their progress, discuss obstacles, and plan their work for the day.
- **When**: Every workday, typically in the morning, and should last no longer than 15 minutes. The Cloud Content Team provides this update asynchronously via Slack.
- **How**:
    - In our team, the Daily Standup is held asynchronously on Slack. Since it's asynchronous, it's important that each team member reads all standup messages, asks and answers questions as necessary, and plans to review PRs if there are any, and provides assistance with blockers whenever possible
    - Each team member posts their updates in the designated Slack channel, answering four key questions:
        - What did I work on yesterday?
        - What will I work on today?
        - Are there any blockers or challenges?
        - List my open PRs needing review.

**3. Backlog Prioritization**

- **What**: Backlog prioritization is the process of determining the order in which product backlog items should be worked on, ensuring the team focuses on the most valuable and urgent tasks first. The prioritization process involves ranking user stories or tasks based on business value, urgency, or other relevant factors.
- **When**: The team 3-in-the-box holds a weekly prioritization meeting, inviting feature leads as needed. The 3-in-the-box may adjust priorities in between these meetings as new information, stakeholder feedback, or business needs emerge.
- **How**:
    - The ‘3-in-the-box’ typically drives the prioritization process, working closely with stakeholders, customers, and the team.
    - The team leader and feature leads provide input on feasibility, effort, and technical dependencies, helping the PM make well-informed prioritization decisions.

**4. Backlog Refinement (Grooming)**

- **What**: Backlog Refinement is an ongoing process where the Delivery Team reviews and revises the Product Backlog to ensure that items are clearly defined, properly prioritized, and have enough detail and understanding for the team to confidently estimate and commit to them during Sprint Planning.
- **When**: The Cloud Team conducts this biweekly, mid-sprint.
- **How**:
    - The Delivery Team reviews the items in the Product Backlog.
    - The team clarifies any requirements, splits large items into smaller ones, and re-prioritizes tasks if necessary.
    - The team will also estimate items if they haven’t been estimated before, ensuring that the backlog is well-defined for the next sprint.
    - The Scrum Leader helps ensure the backlog is well-prepared and facilitates the discussion.

**5. Sprint Review**

- **What**: The Sprint Review is held at the end of the sprint, where the Delivery Team demonstrates the work done to the stakeholders and gathers feedback.
- **When**: At the end of each sprint or completion of an epic. Currently, this ceremony is held as part of the Cloud Team’s weekly meeting.
- **How**:
    - The Product Owner (3-in-the-box) presents the updated Product Backlog and explains what was completed.
    - The Delivery Team demonstrates the work completed during the sprint.
    - A decision is made about the direction of future work based on the feedback gathered.
