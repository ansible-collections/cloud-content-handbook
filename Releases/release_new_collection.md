# Releasing a brand new collection

When releasing a brand new collection for the first time, it's important to engage Partner Engineering (PE) early in the process. This ensures a smoother release by frontloading the review process.

## Steps

1. **Create a Jira ticket and assign it to PE** to review the new collection before the release. This allows PE to identify any potential issues or requirements early, rather than discovering them during the release. Reference ticket: [AAP-51344](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAP-51344).

2. **Include relevant details in the ticket** such as:
   * Collection name and namespace
   * Target release date
   * Collection purpose and scope
   * Any special requirements or dependencies

3. **Follow up with PE** to ensure the review is completed before proceeding with the release.

4. Once PE review is complete, follow the standard [Steps to release a collection to Automation hub and Galaxy](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/Releases/release_collections.md).
