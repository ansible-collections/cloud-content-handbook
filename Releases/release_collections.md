# Steps to release a collection to Automation hub and Galaxy

* Determine the collection version based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). eg: x.y.z
   * For major/breaking change release, increment x. Resulting branch will be x+1.0.0.
   * For minor changes, increment y. Resulting branch will be x.y+1.0.
   * For bugfixes/patch/trivial changes, increment z. Resulting branch will be x.y.z+1.

* In case of a major release, create a new branch `stable-X`, where `X` denotes the major version number. The new branch is based on the main branch.

   ```
   git checkout main
   git branch stable-X main
   ```

* For a minor release, make sure the backport of the PRs from the main branch to the release branch is successful. For backporting of PRs refer to [the backporting documentation](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/backport_changes.md).

* Create and check out a new branch (an ideal branch name is something like `prep_release_x_y_z`, where `x_y_z` are the version numbers, e.g., `prep_release_3_1_0`) and prepare the collection for release by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/collection_contributors/collection_releasing.html#preparing-to-release-a-collection).

   ```
   git checkout -b prep_release_x_y_z stable-X
   ```

* Update the version key in the galaxy.yml file, located in the root directory of the collection, with the appropriate value (x.y.z).

* Update the CHANGELOG:
   * Add a changelog fragment `changelogs/fragments/<version>.yml` for the release summary as follows
   ```
   release_summary: < release content >
   ```
   * Ensure you have the latest version of [`antsibull-changelog`](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/antsibull-changelog/) installed.
   * Confirm there are fragments for all known changes in changelogs/fragments.
   * Run antsibull-changelog release.
   ```
   antsibull-changelog release
   ```

* Verify `CHANGELOG.rst` for the presence of all the changelog fragments.

* Commit the changes and create a pull request into the upstream repository. Make sure you choose `stable-X` as your base branch. This will be the preparation PR for the release.

* Ensure the CI passes before merging. Ideally it is best to wait until the release date (or the day before it) to merge the release prep PR.

* Once the `prep` PR is merged, update the local copy of `stable-X` branch with the latest changes from the `prep` PR.
_Note : If the sanity tests fail locally or in the CI, the failures have to be addressed in a separate PR_

* Tag the version in Git and push to GitHub.

   ```
   git tag -m "Release <version>" <version>
   git push upstream <version>
   ```

* Once the [CI for the release](https://ansible.softwarefactory-project.io/zuul/status) passes, notify the #ansible-partners slack channel about the release, for approval for the release on Automation Hub. `Validated Content collections` and `redhat.openshift` collection are manually uploaded to Automation Hub. To manually upload a collection to Automation Hub, please refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/Release/release_automation_hub.md). Manual upload is performed in cases where automated upload to Automation Hub fails.

* Check for the latest version of the collection on Galaxy and Automation Hub.

* To include an announcement of the release in Bullhorn, tag the newsbot and add a message in the [Ansible-Social Matrix Channel]( https://chat.ansible.im/#/room/#social:ansible.com).

   ```
   Sample message:
   @newsbot
   : amazon.aws 7.0.0 has been released with new bugfixes, features, plugins, and modules. Refer the <changelog> for details!
   ```

* Create a PR in the collection to merge the changes made in the release PR to the the main branch. This can be done manually or using the `cherry-pick` command as given below.

   _This example assumes that the released version is 3.0.0_
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b cherry-pick/stable-3/release_sync
   git cherry-pick -x <commitSHA_from_Stable-3>
   ```
   You can also use [CPythonâ€™s cherry-picker tool](https://pypi.org/project/cherry_picker/#cherry-picking).

   Push the branch to your fork and create a PR into the main branch of the upstream repository. Once the CI passes and the PR is approved, merge it to the main branch.
