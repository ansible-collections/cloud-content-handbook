### Sprint Process Documentation

The organization follows a two-week sprint cycle, running from Thursday to the second Wednesday of the following week. The first day of the sprint typically involves securing approval on all items added to the sprint, along with their assigned story points.

At the start of each sprint, the team determines the sprint goal, which guides the selection of user stories from the backlog to be added to the scrum board.

To effectively assess team capacity before tasks are added to the scrum board, it is beneficial to plan any planned time off (PTO) in advance and inform the team at least two weeks prior.

As the sprint progresses, we can calculate the team's velocity, allowing us to adjust the number of story points we select for future sprints accordingly.

### Sprint Timeline

**Thursday (Sprint Start)**: 
- Previous Friday: Decide on the sprint goal and assess team capacity.

1. **Monday**: 
   - Create a scrum board titled "Cloud Content Scrum <week number>."
   - Pull tasks from the backlog.
   - Set up a meeting room in Kollabe and send invitations to all team members, including the tasks to be discussed.
   - Note: The Cloud Content Kanban Board will no longer be used.

2. **Monday to Wednesday**: 
   - Add story points using [Kollabe](../asynchronous_story_pointing.md).
   - Discuss any necessary clarifications regarding story points via Slack.

3. **Thursday**: 
   - Update story points on the tasks in the Jira scrum board, officially starting the sprint.

4. **Thursday to the following Wednesday**: 
   - Sprint tasks should be completed, with all tasks expected to be closed by Wednesday. If any tasks remain open, lessons learned should be documented, and these tasks will be moved to the next sprint.

Additionally, since we are integrating Kanban methodology, we can move tasks from the backlog to the current scrum board based on team bandwidth and the priority of any new tasks.
