## Sprint Process Documentation

The organization follows a two-week sprint cycle, running from Thursday to the second Wednesday of the following week. The first day of the sprint typically involves securing approval on all items added to the sprint, along with their assigned story points.

At the start of each sprint, the team determines the sprint goal, which guides the selection of user stories from the backlog to be added to the scrum board.

To effectively assess team capacity before tasks are added to the scrum board, it is beneficial to plan any planned time off (PTO) in advance and inform the team at least two weeks prior.

As we proceed with the Scrum sprinting tasks, we can calculate the team's velocity after a few sprints. This will enable us to adjust the number of story points we choose for future sprints accordingly.  Over time, we may identify areas of the process that need adjustment to better align with the team's needs (e.g., how we manage unplanned work).


## Sprint Timeline

---
### Before Sprint Starts

- **Monday to Wednesday Before Sprint:**
	  -  **Sprint Goal:** Ensure the sprint goal is defined and provided by the “Product Owner” or, in Ansible-verse, the team’s 3-in-the-box (PM/Eng Mgr/Tech Lead). This typically happens during a priorities sync earlier in the week.
	  -  **Carryover Work:** Identify any work carried over from the previous sprint and tag it for the upcoming sprint (some tasks may remain in the backlog for now).
	  -  **Refinement & Backlog Estimation:** Complete backlog refinement before sprint planning. The team should hold weekly refinement sessions to ensure estimates are prepared in time for Thursday's planning. For the initial sprints, we will experiment with using the Kollabe tool for this purpose.
	  -  **Process/Communication Changes:** Review any changes or improvements identified in the retrospective regarding processes or communication. Commit to or reiterate these changes before starting the new sprint.

- **Thursday (Sprint Planning for Sprint A):**
	  -  **Sprint Planning:** 
	    - Align on the sprint goal.
	    - Assess team capacity for the sprint.
	    - Pull from the estimated backlog based on previous sprint velocity (note: new work can still be refined during planning, if necessary).
	    - Finalize and agree on the sprint goal and the committed work, then click "start" to begin the sprint.

### During the Sprint

- **Sprint Duration (Thursday to the second Wednesday - Two Weeks):**
	  -  Complete the tasks committed to in sprint planning. All tasks should be closed by the end of Wednesday.
	  -  Any open tasks should be documented with lessons learned and carried over to the next sprint.

---

### After Sprint Ends

- **Playback and Retrospective (Final Wednesday of Sprint A):**
	  - Conduct the sprint playback and retrospective to review the work completed and identify improvements for the next sprint.
	  - Discuss any adjustments to process or communication based on retrospective feedback.



---

### Sprint B Starts

- **Thursday (Sprint Planning for Sprint B):**
	  - Follow the same planning steps as for Sprint A:
	    - Align on the sprint goal and team capacity.
	    - Pull from the backlog based on previous velocity.
	    - Refine any new work as needed during planning.
	    - Agree on the sprint goal and work commitments, then start the sprint.
