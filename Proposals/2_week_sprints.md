### Sprint Process Documentation

The organization follows a two-week sprint cycle, running from Thursday to the second Wednesday of the following week. The first day of the sprint typically involves securing approval on all items added to the sprint, along with their assigned story points.

At the start of each sprint, the team determines the sprint goal, which guides the selection of user stories from the backlog to be added to the scrum board.

To effectively assess team capacity before tasks are added to the scrum board, it is beneficial to plan any planned time off (PTO) in advance and inform the team at least two weeks prior.

As we proceed with the Scrum sprinting tasks, we can calculate the team's velocity after a few sprints. This will enable us to adjust the number of story points we choose for future sprints accordingly.

We will be following the Scrum-Ban (Scrum + Kanban) methodology. We will integrate Kanban features like continuous delivery and limiting work in progress (WIP) into our sprints. Each team member will take on up to 3 WIP items, as we currently do. While we will maintain fixed-length sprints, we will introduce more flexibility by applying Kanban principles. For instance, we can pull work items into a sprint based on our capacity, rather than committing to a predetermined set.
