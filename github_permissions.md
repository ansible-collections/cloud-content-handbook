### Cloud Content repository-specific permissions 

This table specifies the permissions assigned to each team member. If you notice any discrepancies, please inform the team manager or team lead so that the necessary actions can be taken. Each repository will have the admin group and the Subject Matter Expert (SME) with admin rights. Other collaborators, such as the Product Manager (PM), bots, and other team (non-cloud-content) members, will be granted Triage or Read permissions to the supported collections.
