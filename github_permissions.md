# GitHub Permissions and Roles for Cloud Content Team

  

### GitHub Permission Structure for Cloud Team

Anyone at a senior level or above should be added to the **cloud team** within the ansible-collections organization. This group should have maintain permissions on all cloud-related repositories.

The **cloud_triage team** should include individuals who are not yet senior, PMs, or other team members with whom we wish to collaborate on these repositories without granting them full maintain access.

### GitHub Permissions Overview

  

| Permission Level     | Description                                                                                             | Examples                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read                 | Allows users to view and clone code, create issues, review pull requests, and create new pull requests. | View code; Create and review pull requests; Create issues                                                                        |
| Write                | Grants access to commit changes in addition to Read access.                                             | Push changes to the repository; View code and create issues; Create and review pull requests                                     |

| Triage               | Offers more access than Read but less than Write, such as applying or dismissing labels.                | Apply or dismiss labels; Close or reopen issues; View code and pull requests; Cannot edit or delete labels                       |
| Maintain             | Between Write and Admin, ideal for project managers, allowing editing repository metadata.              | Edit repository description; Manage issues and pull requests; Canâ€™t delete issues (restricted to Admin); Manage branches         |
| Owner (Organization) | Full access to the organization, including settings and billing information.                            | Manage account settings; Set up billing and permissions; Assign roles to members                                                 |
