# Argument Validation for Validated Content Roles

The Validated Content Roles for cloud platforms comprise a collection of pre-built YAML content, which includes playbooks and roles. These resources are specifically crafted to address the most common automation scenarios related to cloud operations. For more information on these roles and playbook refer [here](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/validated_content.md)

Starting from ansible version 2.11, an option is available to activate argument validation for roles by utilizing an argument specification.  When this specification is established, a task is introduced at the onset of role execution to validate the parameters provided for the role according to the defined specification. If the parameters do not pass the validation, the role execution will terminate. Thus making the playbook using the role fail fast instead of failing later when an incorrect variable is utilized.

The specification is defined in the meta/argument_specs.yml. For more details on how to write the specification , refer to [this page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#specification-format).

### Objective

At present, the Cloud Validated Content roles do not incorporate argument validation using meta/argument_specs.yml. We have the option to integrate this feature into all newly added roles and can gradually work on implementing it in the existing roles, prioritizing them as needed.
This will enhance the robustness and reliability of our playbooks and roles. 

### Advantages:

* **Enhanced Reliability:** Argument validation guarantees that input data adheres to defined criteria, minimizing the likelihood of unforeseen errors during execution.

* **Improved Error Handling:** Validation failure results in clear error messages, simplifying issue identification and expediting troubleshooting.

* **Prevention of Invalid Input:** Argument validation acts as a safeguard against the use of invalid or incompatible data, identifying issues early in the process.

* **Simplified Maintenance:** Roles with validation are easier to maintain, ensuring functionality across various contexts.

* **Tailored Validation Logic:** Custom validation logic can be defined, enforcing specific input requirements.

* **Error Prevention:** Identifying issues proactively at the argument level minimizes unexpected failures during execution.

### Conclusion

Argument validation significantly contributes to the stability and reliability of our automation. By ensuring roles receive accurate input data and mitigating common issues, we can enhance the effectiveness of our Ansible playbooks using our roles.
